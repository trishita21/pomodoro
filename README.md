## Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

The original technique has six steps:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5 minutes).
5. Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
6. After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
